On the subject of evaluation handlers, it is very simple for a module to define its own evaluation handler.

There are two parts to this process:

1. Inform the <strong>Eval API</strong> module that you are defining a new evaluation handler by implementing hook_evalapi_handler(). This is simply a function that returns an array with information about the handler.

2. Define a callback function that will evaluate a node’s evaluation criteria and return a boolean result.

Modules can optionally define as many evaluation handlers as they like.

Below is <strong>Eval API</strong>’s default evaluation handler:

<pre>
/**
 * Implementation of hook_evalapi_handler().
 *
 * @see _evalapi_default_handler()
 */
function evalapi_evalapi_handler() {
  return array(
    'evalapi' => array(
      'name' => t('Default'),
      'callback' => '_evalapi_default_handler',
    ),
  );
}
</pre>


Its format is as follows below:

<pre>
$handler = array(
  'implementing_module_name' => array(
    'name' => t('Some human readable name'),
    'callback' => 'callback_function_for_evaluating_criteria',
  ),
);
</pre>


Below is Eval API’s default evaluation handler function:

<pre>
/**
 * Default Eval API handler callback.
 *
 * Calculation is performed by counting the number of records in the
 * array and then getting the sum of all boolean values, effectively AND’ing
 * them together. If the array is empty, we assume there are no rules to check
 * and thusly return TRUE.
 *
 * @param $eval_criteria
 *   A node’s evaluation criteria array.
 * @return
 *   - TRUE if the number of array records equals the sum of all the array values.
 *   - FALSE otherwise.
 * @see evalapi_evalapi_handler()
 */
function _evalapi_default_handler(&$eval_criteria) {
  if (empty($eval_criteria)) {
    return TRUE;
  }

  $all_rules  = array();

  foreach ($eval_criteria as $rules) {
    $all_rules = array_merge($all_rules, $rules);
  }

  if (count($all_rules) == array_sum($all_rules)) {
    return TRUE;
  }
  else {
    return FALSE;
  }
}
</pre>


It takes a reference to the evaluation criteria array and returns a boolean.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> It is not required to pass the evaluation criteria as a parameter to the handler function. All that is required of module’s implementing their own evaluation handlers is that a boolean value is returned from the callback function.

It should be noted that the <strong>Eval API</strong> does not provide the means for taking action based on a node’s evaluation. It simply provides the mechanism to define the criteria to be evaluated and the method of evaluation. Other module’s are responsible for determining what to do with the evaluated criteria.

Since a node’s evaluation criteria is dynamic, it is not stored in the database, but rather in the current user’s session and the node object.

Each node that is <strong>Eval API</strong> enabled will store an array in the user’s session that looks like the following:

<pre>
$_SESSION['evalapi_eval_value_NID'] => EVALUATED_VALUE;
</pre>

The property’s value that is attached to the node object follows the same format and will look like the following:

<pre>
$node->evalapi['evalapi_eval_value_NID'] = EVALUATED_VALUE;
</pre>

Where NID is this nid of the node being evaluated, and EVALUATED_VALUE is the returned boolean result of the called evaluation handler.
